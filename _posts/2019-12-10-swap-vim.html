<p>Swapping two words is a good exercise in Vim and its commands, including the <em>text objects</em>.</p>
<p>In this article I will try to solve two possible scenarios for the exchange of position of two words <strong>without using any changes to the basic Vim settings</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="first-scenario">First scenario</h2>
<h3 id="two-words-followed-by-other-words-or-almost-a-space.">Two words followed by other words or almost a space.</h3>
<p><strong>The example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>  TWO ONE THREE</code></pre>
<p>In this scenario you can use the same <em>text object</em> solution from both the first and second word but followed by different commands.</p>
